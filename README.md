a superset language for mcfunction,
basically like TS for JS but for mcfunction,
currently allows you to add nbt data to /execute summon and keep execution entity context when using /schedule,
(/return wont work when used with /execute summon),
you can currently use it by just changing the file extension from .mcfunction to .mcfunctionx or .mcfx for the files in which you wish to use the superset features in and before running /reload running the main.py script,

!!! AT THIS MOMENT VERY VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND PROB HAS A 1_000_000 EDGE-CASES WHERE IT WONT WORK !!!,

in the ./data/ folder you can see an example datapack utilizing these features
